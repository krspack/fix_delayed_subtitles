# synchronize_movie_subtitles
Problem: movie subtitles have a different timing from the movie itself, ie they appear a constant number of seconds ahead or late.

Solution: my simple scriptlet takes as an input a .srt file containing the subtitles and the delay/advance in seconds. The output is a new .srt file with timing corrected.
